# Architecture

The Caliopen client is a react application.

It is [a migration from angular1](https://github.com/CaliOpen/caliopen.web-client-ng). It was using
the [@toddmotto
styleguide](https://github.com/toddmotto/angular-styleguide#angular-1x-styleguide-es2015) in order
to make the migration more easy.

The actual code mainly follows this basic [React
tutorial](http://www.robinwieruch.de/the-soundcloud-client-in-react-redux/) and uses this
recommended [file
structure](https://medium.com/@alexmngn/how-to-better-organize-your-react-applications-2fd3ea1920f1#.4t2oi46lj).
