# Caliopen React Boilerplate

I was unable to have a dead simple app which provide Hot Module Reload (HMR) and Server Side
Rendering (SSR) using actual known boilerplates or CRA.

CRA (https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) is really cool for quick prototyping but
not designed for configuration.

So here it is, I take ideas from all of those boilerplates and started to use Express js, webpack
and some middlewares, that's all.

## Features

* SSR (universaljs, isomorphic)
* redux
* react-router
* webpack ( + webpack-dashboard)
* HMR

## TODO

* support assets
* prefetch redux
